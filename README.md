### Repo for quick start with [**Ha***sura*](https://hasura.io), [**N***ext***J***s*](https://nextjs.org/), [**A***uth0*](https://www.auth0.com)

## This is a work in progress

- [x] Implement Todo app
  - [x] Integrate front-end with Auth0
  - [x] Use Auth0 auth for Hasura interactions
  - [x] Use subscriptions to load list
  - [x] Use mutations to create add to list
  - [x] Use mutations to toggle completion of items
- [x] Convert to typescript
- [ ] Write tests
- [ ] Persist login session
- [ ] Auto graphql query/types generation
- [ ] Implement event/action backend that integrates with Hasura
  - Some ideas that could leverage this:
  - add emojis to item names
  - notifications
- [ ] Write docs for getting started
- [ ] Provide guide or helper for building Auth0 application
- [ ] Provide docs or helper for deploying
  - [ ] Heroku
  - [ ] Render
  - [ ] Vercel
  - [ ] Others?
- [ ] Make the app look pretty
- [ ] Leverage create-nextjs-app (or something similar, like yo) for helping people get started easily
